This ptoject requires these files:

c3-main.cpp
helper.cpp
helper.h


The provide workspace and make files should be used to generate the executable.

Following valuse

filter_res = 0.5
iterations = 0

However the program ran very slow but maximum error was ~0.8, therefore it could have run a little faster if the speed could be hardcoded. The arrow keys do not give consistant results.

SCreenshot results.png captures the end of the run.
